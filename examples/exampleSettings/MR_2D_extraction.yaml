# This is an example of settings that can be used as a starting point for extractting 2D features from MR data 
# This is only intended as a starting point and is not likely to be the optimal settings for your dataset.
# Some points in determining better values are added as comments where appropriate

# When adapting and using these settings for an analysis, be sure to add the PyRadiomics version used to allow you to
# easily recreate your extraction at a later timepoint:

  # Resampling:
  interpolator: 'sitkBSpline'

  # 2D settings
  # force2Ddimension setting is relative to the acquisition plane. For example, the axial plane (0) corresponds to the acquisition plane (axial, sagittal or coronal) of the MRI volume.
  # Therefore, in most cases this setting should not be modified as the axial plane has the best resolution on the original images and is of greater interest.

  # Image discretization:
  binWidth: 5

  # first order specific settings:
  # When normalizing, gray values below the mean will be negative. Shifting by 300 (3 StdDevs * 100) ensures that the
  # majority of voxels is positive (only outliers >3 SD lower than the mean will be negative).
  voxelArrayShift: 300

  # default label value. Labels can also be defined in the call to featureextractor.execute, as a commandline argument,
